## From first message to a working company

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    U["Any first message —<br/>even a bare /team-ops:mops or 'hi'"] --> DZ["Day zero: installed · current ·<br/>signed in · workspace · daemon · runtimes<br/><i>one ladder with its fixes, not six prompts</i>"]
    DZ --> Q{"Three questions:<br/>what exists · what you want ·<br/>who runs the work"}
    U -->|"just a question,<br/>nothing to build"| CONSULT["/team-ops:consult — advise,<br/>zero footprint · no machinery<br/>unless the answer leads there"]
    CONSULT -.->|"'let's build it'<br/>seeds a project"| Q
    Q -->|"nothing, want a team"| SHAPE
    Q -->|"a workspace already"| JOIN["/team-ops:join — audit, then fix<br/>in approved batches"]
    Q -->|"a backlog elsewhere"| IMP["/team-ops:import — mapping shown first,<br/>issues created unassigned"]
    Q -->|"one job, no team"| QJ["Quick job: 3 questions,<br/>1–2 agents, build → review"]
    SHAPE["Shape the work:<br/>what's hard · what it's made of ·<br/>rough size → <b>team proposed with reasons</b>"] --> INT["Interview in waves —<br/>control question second"]
    INT --> STAND["Stand up: conductor → guide +<br/>find-skills → roles → docs skeleton<br/>+ branch protection + docs guard"]
    IMP --> CREW
    Q -->|"a list of tasks, you decide order"| CREW["Crew mode: executors + gates,<br/><b>no conductor</b> — owner is the PM"]
    CREW --> RUN["Work"]
    STAND --> RUN
    QJ --> RUN
    JOIN --> RUN
```

> Nobody is asked to choose a command. Crew mode is the **default offer after `/team-ops:import`
> when no conductor is standing** — someone who just moved their backlog has already decided
> what the work is; a workspace that already has a conductor keeps it. Adding a conductor
> later is an upgrade, not a redo.

## The four routes, side by side

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph INIT["/team-ops:init — a company"]
        I1["shaping → interview"] --> I2["conductor + squads"] --> I3["roadmap · ICE · discovery"]
    end
    subgraph CREW["/team-ops:mops crew — a crew"]
        C1["executors + gates"] --> C2["owner assigns"] --> C3["owner also holds:<br/>accept · skill screening ·<br/>dates · 3rd-round"]
    end
    subgraph QJ["quick job — the whole thing"]
        J1["1–2 agents · build → review · done"]
        J2["<i>and deliberately none of the machinery:<br/>no docs skeleton, no ledger, no modules</i>"]
    end
    subgraph JOIN["/team-ops:join — inherit"]
        N1["audit first"] --> N2["interview delta"] --> N3["fix in approved batches"]
    end
```

## Two seats of Team Advisor

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    OWNER["Owner"]
    OWNER -->|"build · heavy ops<br/>instant · own quota"| CLI["Team Advisor in CLI<br/>shell · git · deploy · full CLI"]
    OWNER -->|"@Team Advisor: status · advice<br/>escalation · async"| MUL["Team Advisor in Multica<br/>resident agent · shared limit<br/>chat shows it only that chat —<br/><b>attach multica-cli to reach the board</b>"]
    CLI -->|writes decisions| STATE["Written state<br/>repo + issue comments<br/>= source of truth"]
    MUL -->|reads + writes| STATE
    STATE -.->|kickoff handoff| MUL
```

## One feature through the conveyor

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    IDEA["Idea"] --> DISC["Discovery:<br/>AS IS to TO BE · audience<br/>competitors · risks · metrics"]
    DISC --> SPEC["Spec in repo<br/>approved by owner"]
    SPEC --> DECOMP["Conductor: staged sub-issues"]
    DECOMP --> S1["Stage 1 · Design<br/>(when UI)"]
    S1 --> S2["Stage 2 · Build<br/>squad leader routes,<br/>executors commit"]
    S2 --> S3{"Stage 3 · Review<br/>parallel gates"}
    S3 --> QA["QA gate"]
    S3 --> DQA["Design QA gate"]
    S3 --> SEC["Security gate"]
    QA & DQA & SEC --> ACC["Stage 4 · Accept<br/>merge · archive"]
    ACC --> SHIP["Ship<br/>deploy · release notes · tag<br/>+ every derived surface regenerated<br/><i>from the tagged ref</i>"]
    SHIP --> MEAS["Measure<br/>vs success metrics"]
    MEAS --> LEARN["Learn<br/>→ ROADMAP.md"]
    LEARN -->|non-stop mode| NEXT["Next feature<br/>from ROADMAP.md"]
    S3 -->|request changes| S2
    S3 -->|same point, 3rd round| CND["Conductor settles<br/>what 'done' means"]
    CND --> S2
```

> A stage is a **barrier, not a queue**: everything genuinely independent goes on the *same*
> stage and runs concurrently — the numbers order dependencies, not tasks. And width is only
> real on a `github_repo` project; a `local_directory` serializes everything regardless.

## Escalation & control

```mermaid
flowchart BT
    EXEC["Executor agent"] --> LEAD["Squad leader"]
    LEAD --> PM["Conductor (PM)"]
    PM --> TEAM_ADVISOR["Team Advisor"]
    TEAM_ADVISOR --> OWNER["Owner<br/><i>the issue is set <b>blocked</b> here —<br/>waiting work must not look alive</i>"]
    EXEC -.->|"destructive only:<br/>delete · publish · spend"| OWNER
```

## Session limits — detect and recover

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    RUN["Run fails: <b>agent_error</b><br/><i>not auto-retried — nothing<br/>brings it back on its own</i>"] --> CHK{"Comment says<br/>resets HH:MM?"}
    CHK -->|yes| WHO{"Will anyone be<br/>at the console then?"}
    WHO -->|yes| WAIT["Wait for reset<br/>(retry before it fails again)"]
    WHO -->|"no — it resets at 07:00"| SCHED["Autopilot, cron pinned<br/><b>after</b> the reset<br/><i>one shot: an autopilot task<br/>never auto-retries</i>"]
    SCHED --> DEL["Delete the trigger once fired<br/><i>a pinned date recurs annually</i>"]
    WAIT --> RERUN["issue rerun<br/>= Retry task"]
    SCHED --> RERUN
    CHK -->|no| DIAG["Read run error<br/>+ daemon logs<br/>(~/.multica/daemon.log)"]
    RERUN --> OK["Work resumes<br/>from repo state"]
```

## Getting current — what `/upgrade` actually walks

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    GO["/team-ops:upgrade"] --> L1{"Is this skill's copy<br/>on your machine current?"}
    L1 -->|"behind"| YOU["<b>Team Advisor runs the update</b> (it has the shell);<br/>you approve. <b>Content applies on next read</b>;<br/><i>restart only for new commands or hooks —<br/>those register at session start</i>"]
    YOU --> L2
    L1 -->|"current"| L2["Read the NEW version's CHANGELOG<br/>— it is the migration map"]
    L2 --> BK["Back up both halves:<br/>skill files + agent config snapshot<br/>+ pre-upgrade SHA in UPGRADES.md"]
    BK --> WS["Migrate the workspace:<br/>missing docs files · guide rules ·<br/>agent instructions · renamed commands"]
    WS --> SK{"Imported skills:<br/>newer upstream?"}
    SK -->|"yes"| SCR["<b>Re-screen</b> against the version<br/>you screened — diff the prose,<br/>not only the scripts"]
    SCR --> SK
    SK -->|"all current"| CLI{"CLI behind,<br/>locally or on a runtime?"}
    CLI -->|"yes"| IDLE{"active_task_count = 0<br/>and nothing in_progress?"}
    IDLE -->|"no"| WAIT["Say what's in flight.<br/>Wait for idle, or /team-ops:mops stop<br/>if the owner accepts it"]
    WAIT --> IDLE
    IDLE -->|"idle"| UPD["<b>Hand over the lines, don't run them</b>:<br/>multica update · runtime update &lt;id&gt; ·<br/>daemon restart<br/><i>self-hosted? the server is the owner's,<br/>and it goes first</i>"]
    UPD --> FP
    CLI -->|"current"| FP["Recompute the fingerprint —<br/><i>after</i> reconciling, never before"]
    FP --> VER{"Behaviour still right?"}
    VER -->|"no"| RB["Restore from the SHA —<br/>rollback is a normal outcome"]
    VER -->|"yes"| DONE["Report what was adapted"]
```

> Two things this picture exists to prevent: **new bytes without a migration** (half the
> company on one version, half on another), and **a CLI replaced under a running agent**,
> which produces failures that look like the agent's fault.

## Something went wrong — whose defect is it?

**The person who just hit it should not have to classify it.** The door decides, from evidence.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    F["friction: something broke,<br/>or made the work harder"] --> Q{"does it stop you now?"}
    Q -->|"yes"| B["the urgent lane —<br/>a blocking issue on your product"]
    Q -->|"no"| W{"whose defect?<br/>decided here, not asked"}
    W -->|"your workspace"| N["a field note in _ops/FIELD-NOTES.md<br/>one line, append-only"]
    N --> S["swept at session end · /status ·<br/>before a release cut"]
    S --> T{"seen twice?"}
    T -->|"yes"| ISSUE["an issue, with BOTH occasions named in it"]
    T -->|"no"| KEEP["stays a note"]
    W -->|"this skill, or Multica"| P["assembled from evidence:<br/>version · flow · symptom · workspace state · files"]
    P --> D["de-identified, a human reads the diff"]
    D --> FILE["written WHOLE to a file<br/>OUTSIDE your repository · path said out loud"]
    FILE --> R["routes named: an issue · the author · keep it"]
    R --> YOU[["you post it — never us"]]
```

> **`/team-ops:report` is the door**, and a sentence reaches the same place. **The file is
> written before anything is missing** — a field it cannot know is marked `unknown` and the offer
> to fill it comes after, because a missing field is not a reason to withhold the artefact.
> Measured: scenario 23 caught the first version stopping to ask, leaving the report as chat text.

## The skill lifecycle — gates, not ceremony

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph CREATE["Create"]
        R1["Routine seen twice"] --> DRAFT["skill-creator draft"]
        DRAFT --> TEST["Tested on a fresh agent<br/>that never saw the routine"]
    end
    subgraph IMPORT["Import"]
        FIND["find-skills / search"] --> SCAN{"Screen:<br/>commands · exfiltration ·<br/>endpoints · grants · injection"}
        SCAN -->|critical| REJ["Rejected<br/>→ _ops/DECISIONS.md"]
        SCAN -->|broad access| HUM["Conductor + security reviewer<br/>never auto-approved"]
        SCAN -->|clean| READ["Someone still reads<br/>what it instructs"]
        HUM --> READ
        READ --> TRIM["Trim to what this company needs"]
    end
    TEST --> OPT
    TRIM --> OPT{"Optimize<br/>fail-closed"}
    OPT -->|"commands · paths · numbers<br/>survive verbatim"| REV["Independent reviewer<br/>confirms meaning held"]
    OPT -->|NOT_COMPRESSIBLE| ATT
    REV --> ATT["Attach with provenance<br/>source · version · date · approver"]
    ATT --> USE["In use"]
    USE -->|"upgrade available"| SCAN
    USE -->|"proved across 2 projects"| REL["Release:<br/>de-identify → owner's own repo<br/>owner-confirmed → re-import as external"]
```

> The loop back to **Screen** on upgrade is the point most setups miss: a version you vetted
> is not the version you are about to install.

## A catch climbs, and a contradiction stops

Two rules that changed how this skill maintains itself, drawn because both are easy to nod at and
hard to follow.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  I([something breaks]) --> N["**noticed**<br/>a dated line in<br/>FIELD-NOTES"]
  N -->|"it happens again"| C["**recurrent**<br/>a backlog item naming<br/>both occasions"]
  C -->|"a week, spent<br/>doing other work"| D["**durable**<br/>a rule in the guide"]
  D -->|"it moved a<br/>measured outcome"| L["**load-bearing**<br/>the always-loaded core"]
  I ==>|"loses work · ships something wrong ·<br/>lets an untrusted string act"| X["repaired NOW —<br/>the ladder governs lessons,<br/>never repairs"]
```

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  Q[one question] --> R1[run 1 · answers A]
  Q --> R2[run 2 · answers B]
  R1 & R2 --> F{"they disagree"}
  F -->|"stop at the SECOND<br/>disagreement"| E["escalate: **the question is unstable**<br/>— and what differed between the askings"]
  F -.->|"rerun until one<br/>agrees with you"| S(("sampling until the answer<br/>is convenient"))
```

**Three attempts bound failure; the second diagram bounds contradiction** — the worse state,
because every run inside it looks like a success. Both are listed by name in the prose-only table
with the exact reason neither is a gate today: `issue runs` records that a run *finished*, not what
it *concluded*, and nothing compares a promotion's citation against its note's date.
