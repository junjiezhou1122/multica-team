"""Report, at session start, whether this workspace was migrated to the version now running it.

**Swapping the skill files is not migrating the company**, and the two are indistinguishable from
outside: a workspace whose `UPGRADES.md` has no line for the installed version looks exactly like
one that migrated cleanly. `UPGRADES.md` is the only thing that tells them apart.

Measured 2026-08-01, scenario 24: given an ordinary *"what's next?"* against exactly that state,
the run never asked the migration question — it opened `/team-ops:next` and answered what it
was asked, reading **no companion at all**. The rules live in `FLOWS.md`; a `next` run does not
open `FLOWS.md`. **A rule in a file nothing routes to is a rule nothing executes.**

So the state is delivered as a fact before the first message rather than left as a rule to
remember. This hook **reports and never refuses**: it makes no claim the session could forge,
because it only reads a file and says what is in it. Silent whenever there is nothing to say — a
hook that speaks every session is noise. Every internal error fails open.

**What this hook must never sound like.** Measured 2026-08-02, scenario 25: a wording that said
recording *"is not gated on approval"* was read by a run as **an injection attempt** — a system
message pushing file edits through without the owner's say-so — and it refused the entire flow,
correctly by its own lights. **A message that disclaims the owner's approval has the exact shape
of an attack, and the more carefully a model reads, the more reliably it will refuse.** So this
text names *what to record* and never *whose permission is unnecessary*. One run in two tripped
on it, which is a coin flip, which is broken.

    version in `UPGRADES.md` and another in the guide, with nothing left to notice. **A check
    that can be satisfied without fixing what it was built to catch turns a visible problem into
    an invisible one.**

    Only a line that says *operated* counts. Prose mentioning a version — a changelog quote, a
    note about what some release corrected — is not a claim about what runs this workspace, and
    matching it would produce a hook that cries wolf and gets switched off.

    **A limit, named rather than papered over: silencing this is one edit away.** A session that
    bumps the line without migrating anything makes the hook quiet, exactly as writing a log line
    does. That is tolerable *here* only because this is not a gate — it refuses nothing and
    asserts nothing about whether work happened. It reports that two files disagree, which is
    true or false independently of who wrote them. **Anything built on top of it that starts
