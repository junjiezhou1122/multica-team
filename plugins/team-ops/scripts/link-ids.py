"""In a project, an id or a path named in passing becomes a link — so Obsidian's graph, GitHub and
any reader see the edge the mention implied.

    link-ids.py [project-root]            report each mention that could be a link — exit 1 if any
    link-ids.py [project-root] --write    rewrite: T-04SMFZ → [T-04SMFZ](tasks/T-04SMFZ-latency-measure.md)

Run as the skill's `scripts/link-ids.py`. **It never runs by itself, and `--write` is the owner's
word** — it changes the project's own files, so it is offered at an upgrade, with the report first
(`/team-ops:upgrade`). Here the tasks live in Multica, so what it mostly finds is a file of
`_ops/` named in another; an id becomes a link only where a file carries it.

Ported from opsinist, where it was measured on a live project on 2026-09-11: 298 links in its
`_ops/`, and 273 mentions in 171 files that could have been.

What becomes a link:
  - **a person, role, team or panel named in a field that names one** — `**Assignee**: Web
    Engineer` becomes a link to the file that is that role, which is the edge between a roster and
    the work that a repository otherwise has no way to walk. **Here the roster is mostly the
    platform's**, so this fires on whatever file layer a project does keep — and every reader of
    such a field un-links before it reads, because a linked declaration hands back its text;
  - an id — `T-04SMFZ`, `R-…` — whose entity file exists: exactly one `<ID>-<slug>.md` or `<ID>.md`
    anywhere in the tree, bare or in backticks;
  - a backticked path of a markdown file in the project — `_ops/DECISIONS.md` — linked relative to
    the file it is written in. The link text keeps what was written, backticks and all.

What never does — the DECLARATIONS readers parse, and the records kept as written:
  - a heading: a task's `# T-… — title` is where the id is declared, not a mention of it;
  - a `**Task**` row or a `task:` line: a declaration — in opsinist the guard reads it by taking
    the last id in the cell, and a link there hands it the slug instead (measured 2026-09-11);
  - `_ops/runs/` (evidence), `_ops/research/raw/` (material), a `## History` section (a log, kept
    as logged), fences, frontmatter, HTML comments, existing links, and a file's own id.
