#!/usr/bin/env bash
# The publish gate held against bash itself, not against what its author expects bash to do.
#   bash scripts/test-gate-vs-bash.sh
#
# **Every case in test-outward-gate.sh states the verdict its author expected**, and in 0.4.18 the
# gate's heredoc blanker was out-guessed five times by commands where that expectation and bash
# disagreed — each found by a lens reading the code, none by a suite. Here the oracle is bash: each
# command runs in /bin/bash against stubs, *published* is read from what the stubs were asked to
# do, and the gate's verdict must agree.
#
# **Reading a result.** A publish the gate lets through is a HOLE. A refusal where nothing would
# have published is LOUD, and fails the suite — except for a case whose reason starts with
# `SYNTAX:`, which marks a command bash itself rejects, where a refusal costs nothing. **Adding a
# case** is one line in CASES: the command, and in a few words what it probes (with `SYNTAX:` in
# front if bash rejects it) — and see TAKES_ARG if it uses a global option that takes an argument.
# **A real outward tool named by its path** — `/usr/bin/git …` — cannot be
# stubbed, so the sandbox refuses to execute it and the refusal counts as the act having been
# tried: only commands that ARE outward acts belong in a case that names a tool by its path.
#
# **It cannot publish, by construction, four ways over** — measured necessary on 2026-09-24, when
# a lens testing this very gate with a stub `git` pushed a real branch: the installed gate refused
# the command that made the stub, the lens did not notice, and PATH fell through to the real git.
# So (1) PATH holds the stubs and an allowlist of harmless tools and nothing else, under `env -i`;
# (2) every stub is checked present before each run; (3) bash runs under `sandbox-exec` with the
# network denied; and (4) the same sandbox refuses to EXECUTE any binary named like an outward
# tool outside the stub directory, by any path. A canary proves (4) before any case runs.
# **Without `sandbox-exec` it runs no bash at all, and reports that as a failure** — a suite that
# skips itself green is the false clean this repository keeps paying for. On a machine without it,
# run the suite on macOS; CI already does.
#
# Two code mutants must each open a HOLE, or the suite has no teeth: a terminator matched anywhere
# in a line rather than as the whole line, and a dry-run window that runs past the substitution
# holding the act.
