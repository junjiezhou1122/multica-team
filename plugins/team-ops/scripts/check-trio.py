"""The Trio line of a release entry says what the release added — this measures whether it did.

    python3 scripts/check-trio.py            # the newest entry, against the last tag before it
    python3 scripts/check-trio.py 0.2.19     # a released entry, against the tag before its own

Every entry ends with a `**Trio:**` paragraph naming the diagrams, situations and facts the
release added. 0.2.19 here and 0.4.18 in the sibling each shipped a Trio line that undercounted
its own release — the numbers are in each entry's marked correction: the lens rounds read each
repair's diff and nothing read the entry against the release as a whole (the owner, 2026-09-25).

What is measured, between the tag before the entry and the entry's own tag (or the working
tree for the unreleased one):
- **diagrams** — mermaid blocks, net, across every tracked `.md` but the changelog;
- **situations** — data rows, net, in the use-case file (`use-cases.md` · `USE-CASES.md`);
- **facts** — numbers new in `facts.md`, or entries new in `sources/SOURCES.md` (`### id · …`).

The claim is read from the Trio paragraph: a number word or digits before *diagram(s)* and
*situation(s)*, `no diagram` / `no situation` as zero, and for facts every bold number or range
after `facts.md` — or a number word before *register entr(y|ies)*. **A kind the paragraph does not
mention is not compared** — a Trio line is prose, and a phrasing this cannot read is reported as
unread rather than guessed. Exit 1 on a mismatch, 2 when there is nothing to compare.

**Named limits**: the counts are NET, so a diagram or a situation removed elsewhere in the same
release lowers them — the line then states the net, or names the removal; and a number word is
read as the house writes it, `twenty-four` with its hyphen (`twenty four` reads as four); and a
bare bold number joined to the facts by `·` or `;` is read as a fact, so the next item names its
word the way the house does (`suite **9**`, never `· **9**`).
