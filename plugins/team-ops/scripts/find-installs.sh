# fourteen installs — nine of them symlinks resolving to a directory that did not exist, so the
# skill was wired into nine harnesses and loading in none of them, and two more copies sat on the
# previous version. Every one of those states is silent by construction: a broken symlink fails
# only when followed, a drifted copy announces nothing, and a config mount outlives the path it
# points at. The claim "updated everywhere" is only as good as the list of everywhere, and this
# script generates that list rather than recalling it.

# OF a git clone still at 0.4.7, so `git pull --ff-only` refused — permanently, and every release
# after — with *"Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten"*. The output is
# the trap: git prints `Aborting` and `Updating <old>..<new>` on adjacent lines, so a glance reads
# it as success while the install sits two versions behind. Two delivery routes were used on one
# directory, and the second one broke the first.

  # `restore --source=HEAD` deletes a staged new file, because a path absent from HEAD is restored
  # to not existing. A discard belongs to whoever owns the work — this says what is at risk and
  # offers the reversible move.
  #
  # **Detection is repo-wide because the route is**: `git pull --ff-only` aborts on a modified
  # tracked file anywhere in the enclosing repository, so scoping detection to the install goes
  # silent on a route that is genuinely broken. `--diff-filter=MDRT` counts only tracked files that
  # exist in HEAD and differ from it — a staged new file cannot be overwritten by an incoming
  # commit that does not know it, and an untracked file never blocks a fast-forward. AT RISK, not

  # short of shipping the fourth work-destroying remedy in this function. `--no-renames`
  # decomposes that R into D at the OLD path, which is both present in HEAD and the path an
  # incoming commit can actually collide with. Every path MDT prints exists in HEAD; MDRT's do not.

  # and counting every untracked file would fire on nearly every install — which is the false
  # positive that started this whole sequence. **An earlier version of this comment said flatly

  # into a rule it does not support, in a function whose changelog entry accuses an earlier repair

DISCARD one, only from THAT list: git -C "%s" restore --staged --worktree --source=HEAD -- <that path> — every path it prints exists in HEAD, so restore cannot delete it, and --staged is required or the index keeps differing while this flag reads clean.
