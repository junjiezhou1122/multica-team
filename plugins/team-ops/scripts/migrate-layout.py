"""Move a pre-0.4.0 workspace's `docs/` machinery into the `_ops/` layout — as history, not as loss.

    python3 scripts/migrate-layout.py <project-root> [--dry-run]

Before 0.4.0 everything the methodology owned lived under `docs/`, mixed into whatever
documentation the project already had. `_ops/` sorts first, collides with nothing, and gives
the root back to the craft.

Three properties this script exists to have:

**It moves only what it recognises.** The claimed list below is the canonical layout table
(BOOTSTRAP §7) and nothing else. **A `docs/` entry it does not know is left exactly where it
is and named in the output** — that directory is very often the project's own, and a migration
that swallows a craft's documentation is worse than no migration.

**Every move is a `git mv`**, so blame and history survive; an untracked file is moved plainly.

**It is its own diff.** A dirty tree is refused, because a migration mixed into unrelated work
is a diff nobody can review. It is idempotent — a second run finds nothing and says so — and a
destination that already exists is a `CONFLICT` line and a nonzero exit, never a silent
overwrite.
