# Sources register

The evidence behind the skill's slow-rotting claims. Every claim the skill makes about the
outside world that will **not** change week to week has an entry here; Team Advisor answers *"where did
you get this?"* — in any phrasing — from this file (REFERENCE §7, SKILL "Say what you know").
**It is read by whichever flow needs it, and it is read first** — a register entry serves every
flow that meets its need, and the live web is where the register runs out, not where it starts
(FLOWS → *a shelf serves every flow*).

**What belongs here — and what never does.** The register holds **slow-rotting canon only**:
findings, methods and standards that age in years. **Fast-rotting facts never enter** — a price, a
current API limit, a competitor's live feature stay *fetch-at-decision-time* rules, quoted with
their check-date at the moment of use, never cached here to rot.

**One fixed form per entry**, so a wrong entry is visibly wrong:
**id · full citation · live URL/DOI/arXiv · archive link · licence · one-paragraph distillate
(our words) · check-date · cited-by**

**`Reads against` is the field that stops a register becoming a pile.** A register that can only
answer *"what do we have on X"* will hold two entries pulling opposite ways and never say so. The
field names the entries this one must be read beside **and what the tension is**, or one of two
words that are not the same answer: **`none found`** — looked, nothing here pulls against it — or
**`not checked`**, honest ignorance. An empty field is a defect; the two words are not. **It is
symmetric**, and `python3 scripts/fetch-source.py --verify-reads` refuses the pair that only points
one way. **Ported from the sibling 2026-09-10, where it caught two one-way pairs on its first run**;
here it reported **15 of 15 still `not checked`** on arrival, which was a fact about this register
rather than a defect in it. The first pair to name each other is the tool-format pair at the end.

**A back-pointer names a section and proves what it said** — `file.md#anchor (sha:…, checked …)`
— minted by `scripts/fetch-source.py --cite <file.md>#<anchor>`. A line number names a *position*,
and a position moves the next time a paragraph is inserted above it: **measured 2026-08-07, 11 of
23 line-number pointers no longer landed on their claim**, with no edit to this register in
between. The hash earns the rest — a passage rewritten *underneath* its citation makes the fact
`unknown` and says so, where a line number cannot even see it. The one thing the anchored form
cannot cite is a passage with no heading above it; that is a reason to give a load-bearing
passage a heading, and until then the line form is used and marked as such.

**Licence tiers** (they decide what we may hold): **free** — an open licence (MIT, CC, a public
standard); a copy may be carried later. **copyrighted** — citation + archive link + our own
distillate, never the text itself. **math** — a formula recorded by name, which is not
copyrightable. Each entry states its tier.

**Upkeep.** `scripts/fetch-source.py` builds and checks these entries: `--resolve <doi|arxiv|url>`
prints a skeleton, `--archive <url>` triggers a Wayback snapshot, `--verify` walks every live URL.
`--verify-citations` walks the **other** edge — every cited-by back into the doc that cites it —
naming any pointer a rewrite left behind, and any entry the skill no longer cites at all (one
parked for a later release stays named every run, which is the point: a deferral nobody is
reminded of is a deletion). Both run each release (AGENTS.md → Cutting a release).

## Persona theatre — grounding, fidelity, and the limits of synthetic audiences

### park-self-reports · Park et al., self-report-grounded individual simulation
- **Citation:** Park, J.S., et al. "LLM Agents Grounded in Self-Reports Enable General-Purpose Simulation of Individuals." arXiv:2411.10109 (2024; v1 was "Generative Agent Simulations of 1,000 People").

- **Licence:** copyrighted (author © under arXiv's non-exclusive distribution licence) — cite + archive + our distillate
- **Distillate:** Agents built from a person's **own self-reports** reproduce that person's survey answers at **83%** (interview-grounded) / **82%** (survey-grounded) / **86%** (both) of the person's two-week test-retest ceiling, versus **74%** for demographics-only; a free-text "persona paragraph" scores **0.71**, below even the demographics baseline (0.74). Self-report grounding also **reduces accuracy disparities** across racial and ideological groups. The takeaway the skill leans on: the grounding artifact — the interview transcript — *is* the product, not a written bio.

- **Licence:** copyrighted (Stanford HAI, free to read) — cite + archive + our distillate
- **Distillate:** The policy brief frames the **consent machinery** for simulating individuals and legitimizes the **AI-conducted interview** as the grounding step. It matches the v1 ("1,000 People") framing and carries the stronger **"demographic personas amplify stereotype bias"** phrasing that the current peer-reviewed version later softened to "reduces accuracy disparities" — which is why the skill attributes the sharper claim to the brief, not the paper.

- **Distillate:** Sycophancy — telling the user what they want to hear — is a **trained-in property** of RLHF'd assistants, consistent across several models and tasks. A persona built on such a model **inherits that compliance**, which is why the theatre's calibration layer suppresses sycophancy explicitly (a synthetic respondent is a pleaser unless corrected).

- **Citation:** jdx/mise, `src/toolset/outdated_info.rs` (main branch, read 2026-09-11), and the `mise outdated`, `mise ls` and `mise bootstrap` help of mise 2026.9.5.

- **Archive:** archive: pending  (run: fetch-source.py --archive https://github.com/jdx/mise/blob/main/src/toolset/outdated_info.rs)
- **Licence:** MIT — a copy may be carried; only our distillate is held
- **Distillate:** `mise outdated --json` is an object keyed by tool — `requested`, `current` (null when not installed), `bump`, `latest`, and `release_url` (omitted when the backend publishes none). **`latest` means the newest version inside the pin without `--bump`, and the newest at all with it**; `bump` is the new pin at the old pin's precision (`22` becomes `24`). **A tool whose lookup fails is dropped from the JSON with only a warning on stderr**, so an offline run and a current one both print `{}`. The short `-l` is deprecated and becomes `--local` in 2027.8.5. Measured on 2026.9.5: a `mise.toml` with `[tools]` alone is read on any machine, while one carrying `[bootstrap.packages]` is refused by every command until `mise trust`.

- **Reads against:** `npm-outdated` — they agree, and that is the finding: npm's *wanted* is mise's *latest* without --bump, npm's *latest* is mise's with it, so one report can sort both by the same line

### npm-outdated · npm, `npm outdated` — an update inside the range, and a move beyond it
- **Citation:** npm CLI documentation, *npm-outdated*, and `lib/commands/outdated.js`, npm/cli `latest` branch, read 2026-09-11.
- **Live:** https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/commands/npm-outdated
- **Archive:** archive: pending  (run: fetch-source.py --archive https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/commands/npm-outdated)
- **Licence:** copyrighted (npm, a GitHub company) — cite + our distillate
- **Distillate:** `wanted` is the newest version that satisfies the range in `package.json`; `latest` is the version tagged latest in the registry, and npm's own output colours the first *update now* and the second *proceed with caution*. With `--json` the answer is an object keyed by package name whose value becomes an **array** when one name is outdated in two places; `current` is absent when the package is not installed; the command exits 1 whenever anything is outdated, so its exit code says nothing about whether it answered.

- **Reads against:** `mise-outdated` — the same line drawn for runtimes and tools: they agree, which is what lets the pin, not the numbering, decide what is routine

### pep-594 · Python 3.13 removed nineteen standard-library modules
- **Citation:** Python Software Foundation, *What's New In Python 3.13*, "Important removals"; PEP 594, "Removing dead batteries from the standard library".
- **Live:** https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.13.html
- **Archive:** archive: pending  (run: fetch-source.py --archive https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.13.html)
- **Licence:** copyrighted (© Python Software Foundation) — cite + our distillate
- **Distillate:** 3.13 removed the nineteen "dead batteries" deprecated in 3.11 — aifc, audioop, cgi, cgitb, chunk, crypt, imghdr, mailcap, msilib, nis, nntplib, ossaudiodev, pipes, sndhdr, spwd, sunau, telnetlib, uu and xdrlib — and the 2to3 tool with lib2to3. A minor version number that breaks any code importing one of them: the reason the line between a routine update and a decision is the project's own pin, not the version's numbering.
