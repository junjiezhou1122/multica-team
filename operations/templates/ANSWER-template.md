# Answer shapes — the three a consultation actually gets asked

**Open this before answering a question that has no thing to build** (FLOWS → Consult). Every
answer of these kinds ends in **one named thing**, and the slots below are what make that
checkable. A slot with nothing in it is written `unknown` — never dropped, because a missing
slot and a slot nobody could fill look identical afterwards.

**Measured in `opsinist` on 2026-07-31, N=5 per scenario:** six consultation scenarios failed
**every single instance**, all the same way — a symmetric list of options handed back for the
owner to evaluate. *"Supabase or Convex"* got balanced pros and cons and a clarifying question;
*"what should I use for transactional email"* got four vendors with recalled prices; *"how long
to build currency conversion"* got an estimate with no search behind it. **None of them was
wrong about its subject. Each stopped one step before the answer.**

**This applies to both seats.** Team Advisor-in-Multica's chat answers are consultations by default, and
a chat comment is exactly where a menu feels most natural and helps least. Short is fine — a
sentence per slot beats a page without them.

## Depth — chosen before the run, and priced when it is offered

**This is the price list; the field lives on the finding.** An answer worth keeping becomes
`research/<question>.md` in the workspace (`templates/FINDING-template.md`), which carries `Depth:` as a
required field — one layer, one home. Use the table below to **quote the rung before the work**,
and quote it in the words of what it buys rather than in hours.
**A research document that does not say how hard anyone looked reads as if someone looked hard**,
which is the failure this field exists to stop. The owner picks; where they have not, the advisor
**proposes one with its price and waits**, because how long this takes is a spend and spending is
owner-confirmed (`SECURITY.md`).

| Depth | What it buys | What it costs | What it does **not** buy |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`orienting`** | is there an answer at all, and where does it live — a handful of sources, the shape of the disagreement, no synthesis | minutes, one turn | anything quotable. **This is a direction, not a finding** |
| **`deciding`** | enough to make the call and defend it: the canonical sources for *this* question, their tensions named, each one an entry in the register | tens of minutes, several turns and a few fetches | completeness. It answers the question asked, not the field around it |
| **`standing`** | something that will be quoted back in a year: everything `deciding` buys, plus every entry's `Reads against` **completed rather than `not checked`**, and an archive link per source | hours, and it is the only rung worth saying no to | a guarantee. It rots like everything else — `Research rots as a whole document` |

**Say the number before the work, not after.** The three rows above are the estimate the owner is
agreeing to; if the run outgrows its rung, that is a **new** question at a new price, not a quiet
overrun — the same rule a task follows when it outgrows its container.

**Native-first, answered 2026-09-10:** no runtime offers a research-depth setting, so this is
ours to hold. Deep-research products solve it with automatic tier routing and a budget cap; the
part worth borrowing is that **the tier is decided before the first fetch and stated**, and the
part not worth borrowing is deciding it silently on the owner's behalf.

## 1 · Choose between named options

> *"Postgres or SQLite?"* · *"Which tracker?"* · *"What should we use for X?"*

| Slot | What goes in it |
|---|---|
| **the pick** | one of them, named in the first sentence — or **the condition that decides**, stated so the owner can answer it from what they already know |
| **why this one here** | the property of *their* situation that moved it, not the general merits |
| **what it costs them** | what they give up by taking the pick — every real choice has one |
| **what the claim rests on** | fetched with its date, or `unknown`. A price, a limit or a tier recalled from memory is `unknown` (REFERENCE → fetched at the moment it is asked) |
| **what they already hold** | read from the workspace before the search — an existing choice outranks a better default |
| **when to revisit** | the moment that would change the answer, never a date |

**A comparison table is allowed and is not the answer.** If the table is the last thing in the
reply, the reply is a menu. **Symmetry is the tell**: two columns of equal length, each ending
in *"depends on your priorities"*, is a decision handed back.

## 2 · Find me something

> *"Find me photos"* · *"Send me some inspiration"* · *"Where do I get X for free?"*

**The pick and why · what each claim rests on, quoted in the page's own words · what the
workspace already holds · where it lands when used · and its origin, named** — `found` (where) ·
`already ours` (which record says so) · **`made by us just now`**.

**Line two says *quoted* for a measured reason.** An earlier version of this form asked for the
page and the date, and the next run filled it with three check-dates for pages it had never
opened. **A slot invites a filled slot**, and *"I checked"* is unfalsifiable and therefore free;
what a page *said* cannot be produced without reading it.

**And the direction is discovered, not assumed:** what it is for, and what the owner has already
committed to, are asked. Everything else takes a default **stated as an assumption**. A
refinement — *"warmer, no people"* — is a constraint that does not expire.

## 3 · How long, how much, how big

> *"How long to build X?"* · *"What would this cost?"*

| Slot | What goes in it |
|---|---|
| **does it already exist** | **searched, before any number is written.** The cheapest build is the one nobody does, and an estimate produced without this step answers the wrong question |
| **the number, and what it is of** | the scope it covers, and what is deliberately outside it |
| **what it rests on** | comparable work, or a named assumption — never a feel |
| **what would move it most** | the one unknown whose answer changes the figure most |

**An estimate with no search behind it fails this shape even when the number is reasonable** —
measured 5 of 5 on *"I need currency conversion in my app. How long to build it?"*, where the
thing asked about ships as a free API.

## The line all three share

**A list is not an answer.** Every one of these ends in a recommendation with a reason, or a
**named gap** — *"this cannot be had as asked, and here is which part"* — which is a good answer
and a complete one. What it never ends in is a set of options with the choice handed back.

**And the bridge stays where it was:** if the answer leads to building, it is offered **once**,
and what the consultation established — the question, the shaping answers, the findings **with
their rungs intact** — crosses with it rather than being re-asked (FLOWS → When the consultation
becomes a project).
