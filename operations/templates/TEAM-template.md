# Team — who owns what

Agents **and** people. This is what `/team` reports from, what `/fire` reads before it
offboards anyone, and what tells a new arrival who to ask.

## People

| Person | Role | **Expert in** | Owns | May direct Team Advisor to | Signs off on |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| {{Name}} | {{owner}} | {{iOS, audio DSP}} | {{the product}} | {{everything}} | {{spend · anything outward}} |
| {{Name}} | {{designer}} | {{brand, typography}} | {{brand, design system}} | {{design flows}} | {{published visuals}} |

**The "Expert in" column changes how everyone talks to that person**, which is why it is
asked at the interview and belongs here rather than in someone's memory. **Inside** those
areas: terse and technical, real decisions routed to them, no explaining the basics.
**Outside** them: explain the tradeoffs and recommend, don't drop a bare choice on them.
Getting this backwards is the most reliable way to be annoying — lecturing an expert, or
handing a stranger to the field a decision they have no basis to make.

## Agents

| Agent | Mention (`mention://agent/<uuid>` — uuid = the ID column of `multica agent list`) | Craft | Squad | Grade | Model tier | Owns |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| {{Conductor}} | {{`[@Name](mention://agent/<uuid>)` — copied whole, this is what dispatches}} | {{PM}} | {{— project lead}} | {{senior}} | {{top}} | {{backlog order · specs · the skill inventory}} |
| {{Web Engineer}} | {{`[@Name](mention://agent/<uuid>)`}} | {{engineering}} | {{Eng}} | {{mid}} | {{mid}} | {{`site/`}} |

**Keep it current or it lies:** hiring, firing, a squad change or a grade change updates
this file **in the same task** — the roster is also what `/sync` compares the live
workspace against, so drift here shows up as a false alarm there.

## Archived (the talent pool)

{{Agents archived rather than deleted, with what they were for. Archiving is reversible;
re-hiring a known-good specialist beats building one from scratch.}}
