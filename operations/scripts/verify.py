    The patterns that read this use `[^.\n]` to stay inside one sentence, so a newline is their

    **Both directions were wrong once.** Flattening nothing missed the mutant: this corpus hard
    wraps at ~98 columns, so a retracted rule became invisible the moment it straddled a line
    break, and the guard reported clean over the sentence it exists to refuse (measured
    2026-08-21, in this guard's own first hour). Flattening EVERYTHING then matched across
    headings, blank lines and list items — none of which contains a full stop — so honest prose
    under two unrelated headings read as one sentence (measured 2026-08-23: a heading, a bullet
    about mentions, a second heading, and a bullet about counters being free, matched as a single
    claim). The middle is the only correct answer: a wrapped paragraph is one sentence, and a new
    block is a new thought.

    **Same-length substitution, always** — newline to a single space, or newline kept. Every
    offset still points at the original byte, so the reported line number stays true; that is
    load-bearing, not tidiness, because the caller counts newlines up to `m.start()`.
