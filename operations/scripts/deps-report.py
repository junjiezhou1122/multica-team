"""What the project depends on, why, and how much each available update matters.

Run from a project's root, as the skill's `scripts/deps-report.py`:

    deps-report.py          the updates — asks the tools that know; needs the network
    deps-report.py --why    what the project uses and why — its own files only, offline

**The updates come from the tools that already know**, never from a list kept here:

    mise outdated --json --local           mise.toml: the newest version INSIDE each pin
    mise outdated --json --local --bump    ... and the newest at all, OUTSIDE it
    npm outdated --json --long             package.json: `wanted` inside the range, `latest` beyond
    osv-scanner scan source --recursive --format json .    published vulnerabilities, every lockfile

and each answer is sorted by what it asks of the owner:

    security      a published vulnerability in something the project ships — act first
    outside pin   newer than what the project pinned: a decision, and the release notes are its map
    inside pin    a newer build of what was already chosen — routine
    missing       declared, and not installed on this machine
    not checked   the tool that would know is absent, offline, or answered in a shape not read here

**The line between routine and decision is the project's own pin, not the version's numbering**
(PLAYBOOKS.md → *When something it needs has a newer version*). The last line says what was asked,
so an empty report reads as *current* and never as *nobody looked*.

**It never installs, upgrades, trusts or changes anything** — `mise trust` included. A report, not a
gate: it exits 0 whatever it finds. The gate on what is declared is the guard's §19.

What each tool prints was read from its own source on 2026-09-11, not assumed:
  mise `src/toolset/outdated_info.rs` — `latest` is the newest INSIDE the pin without `--bump` and
    the newest AT ALL with it, so the two answers are kept apart and never merged; `current` is null
    when not installed; **a tool whose lookup failed is dropped from the JSON, leaving only a warning
    on stderr** — so an empty answer beside that warning is "not checked", never "current". Never
    `-l`: it means `--bump` today and becomes `--local` in mise 2027.8.5.
  npm `lib/commands/outdated.js` — an object keyed by name, whose value becomes an ARRAY when one
    name is outdated in two places; `current` absent when not installed; exit 1 whenever anything
    is outdated, which is one reason no exit code is read here.
  osv-scanner `docs/output.md` — vulnerabilities grouped by shared aliases, so one advisory published
    under two ids is counted once.
