# Reruns work that a run left mid-flight OR that a failed run rolled back:
#   • ASSIGNED, INTERRUPTED tasks (in_progress/in_review) — agents resume from the
#     repository state, hence the team rule to commit incrementally.
#   • todo issues whose LATEST run failed with agent_error — a failed task rolls its
#     issue back in_progress → todo (REFERENCE §7), so those need a rerun too. Task
#     history (`issue runs`) tells them apart from untouched backlog, which is NEVER
#     touched: an untouched todo/backlog issue has no failed run and waits on its
#     --stage barrier.
#
# cancelled: an intentional cancel always carries a "Cancel reason:" comment;
# --revive-cancelled revives ONLY marker-less ones (accidental), then reruns.
#
# --dry-run: report what WOULD be reran/revived without calling the platform. Safe
# offline (no live workspace needed) — for sanity-checking the selection logic.
#
# Usage: bash resume.sh [--revive-cancelled] [--dry-run] [--project <id>]
