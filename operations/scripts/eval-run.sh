#
# **Isolation is the whole point, and it has three parts** — a round that skips any of them
# produces a number that looks like a result and measures something else:
#
#   1 · **a config dir of its own** — measured 2026-08-02: run under the author's own config, a
#       player answered *"what's next?"* by opening a DIFFERENT operations skill installed on
#       the same machine and running that one's flow. A shared config is how another plugin
#       gets a vote.
#   2 · **the corpus under test, copied** — so a mid-round edit cannot reach a run already
#       counted. The skill is frozen for a round; this makes that mechanical.
#   3 · **the test workspace, passed explicitly** — never the profile default, which can be
#       switched between runs by anything. `MULTICA_WORKSPACE_ID` scopes each call without
#       touching the owner's own default, where `workspace switch` would.
#   4 · **the skill's own corpus readable** — `--add-dir "$BOX/plugin"`. Measured 2026-08-07 and
#       the most consequential of these: the always-loaded core arrives as the skill body, but
#       every companion — FLOWS, PLAYBOOKS, BOOTSTRAP, REFERENCE, `sources/SOURCES.md` — sits
#       outside the working directory and `Read` on it was **denied**. Rounds before this fix
#       measured a skill that could not open its own files, which quietly confounds every
#       failure that depends on one: scenario 15 never opened the sources register because it
#       *could not*, not because it did not think to.
#   5 · **no MCP servers but the ones named here** — `--strict-mcp-config` with an empty set.
#       A config dir of its own is not enough: measured 2026-08-07 on scenario 19, the player
#       had 63 tools and reached the owner's **claude.ai Linear connector** through ToolSearch,
#       asking it for the issues instead of asking Multica. Two failures in one — the run
#       measured a tracker the scenario is not about, and a player one tier below the floor was
#       one approval away from reading the owner's real backlog.
#
# The player is never shown the rubric and gets only what a user would actually say. Nothing
# here judges: judging reads the transcript afterwards, by someone who did not produce it.

# **The workspace half is rebuilt before EVERY run, not once per scenario.** Measured

# changed, and their "nothing to reassign" was true of the wreckage rather than of the
# situation. A scenario that acts on its own fixture invalidates every run after the first
# unless the situation is rebuilt, and the rubric says the same thing about scenario 24's board.
# **A scenario the runsheet says needs state, with no builder, is REFUSED — not run and shrugged
# at.** `eval-fixture.py` prints "its builder is not written yet" and the round used to carry on,
# producing a transcript that looks gradeable and measures a player standing in an empty
# workspace. Measured 2026-08-15: a focused round dispatched 18 and 27 this way — 18's poisoned
# webhook payload arrived as the OWNER's own words, which is a different scenario with a
# different right answer, and two of 27's three runs reported "the repository is empty" while
# the third inspected THIS repository's own gate. Six of the eleven scenarios the runsheet marks
# `rubric-setup` have no builder. The sibling paid for this exact shape with a void round whose
# headline measured nothing; the lesson travels as a refusal rather than as a paragraph.
# A scenario's state has TWO independent halves and the runsheet has one yes/no, so the guard is
# written to see what is MISSING rather than to guess which half was meant. Every `FIXTURE.md`
# states the model outright: "**Repository half only.** Where a scenario needs workspace state as
# well, its builder lives in `scripts/eval-fixture.py`."
#
#   repository half : tracked files under evals/fixtures/<id>/ beyond FIXTURE.md itself
#   workspace half  : an entry in eval-fixture.py's BUILDERS
#
# Refuse only when a scenario the runsheet marks as needing state has NEITHER. Measured 2026-08-15
# (pass ten), against all 27 rows:
#   the first form ($3 == rubric-setup, no builder)  refused 6 and MISSED scenario 27 — one of the
#     two voids it was written to prevent, named in its own commit message and round record
#   "$5 == yes, no builder"                          refused six at the time this was written
#     fully provisioned with 5-7 tracked files — it would report "the rig is broken" about
#     scenarios that build fine, which is what the first attempt did and was rewritten to avoid
#   "…or a fixtures/<id> directory exists"           refuses 5, re-admitting 14, 15 and 26; 14's
#     directory holds exactly one tracked file, FIXTURE.md, a prose stub whose on-disk `_ops/`
#     is untracked and vanishes in a clone
# This form refuses NOTHING-AT-ALL and WARNS where one half is present and the other is not,
# which is information the operator can act on rather than a wall.
# **The list that used to sit here — "refuses 3 · 11 · 14 · 18 · 23 · 27" — is gone rather than
# corrected, because it was a dated claim about a corpus that moves.** On 2026-08-21 all six got
# halves (3 and 27 repository, 3 · 11 · 18 · 23 builders, 14 declared needs-fixture=no), so the
# sentence became false for every id it named on the day the work it described was finished. A
# check's comment may say what the check DOES; the moment it enumerates which inputs it currently
# refuses, it has copied a table that lives elsewhere and will rot without anyone editing it.
# The three lines above record how this form was CHOSEN, with the counts measured that day. They
# are history, not a live claim — the ids they name have moved since (2026-08-21), and a comment
