"""Build and tear down a scenario's workspace state in the TEST workspace.

    python3 scripts/eval-fixture.py <scenario-id> teardown

**A fixture that encodes something else does not fail the scenario — it invalidates the run,
and it looks like a result** (evals/README). So this builds the situation from nothing every
time rather than trusting what a previous round left behind, and it tears down what it made.

**Teardown verbs differ per entity, and saying which was used is part of the record**: issues
have no delete at all (`update --status cancelled` is the whole answer from the console),
agents and properties **archive**, and projects, skills, labels and autopilots **delete**. A
left-behind autopilot spends quota on nobody's behalf, which is why it is deleted rather than
disabled.

Everything is tagged `EVAL-<id>-` in its title so a sweep can find its own litter and nothing
else. The workspace comes from `EVAL_WORKSPACE_ID` — never the profile default, which anything
can switch between runs.
