## Services by need

| Need | Default | What you'd use it for |
|---|---|---|
| **Linked** | **[Foo](https://foo.example)** (MIT) · [Qux](https://qux.example) | an Unlinked Explainer in the third column is not an entry |
| **Cross-reference** | Foo (above) · **[Bar](https://bar.example)** | the entry was linked where it stands |
| **Method** | **AARRR** — funnel metrics · **[Baz](https://baz.example)** | a method, not a project |
| **Licence** | **[Quux](https://quux.example)** (**AGPL-3.0**) · **MIT** for the SDK | bold licence text |
| **Command** | `npm audit` · [osv](https://osv.example) | a command in backticks |

## Picking a tool

| Tier | What it means |
|---|---|
| **one** | Plain Name in a table that is not a shelf |

## Evidence

| Need | Anchor | Why this one | Free tier |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Four columns** | **[Corge](https://corge.example)** | the sibling's shape | ✅ |
