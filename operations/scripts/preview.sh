# 2026-08-01): images, PDF, HTML, and text-as-source. Everything else — video, audio, Office,
# archives, design files, unknown binaries — arrives as a download nobody opens. A rule that
# merely ASKS an agent to "render a preview" is the class of rule this project has twice
# measured as not holding, so this is a script that produces the rendition or exits non-zero
# with a named reason. Silence is the failure it removes.
#
# Usage:  bash scripts/preview.sh <file>
# Prints, in attach order, the paths to attach — the rendition first, the original last:
#     bash scripts/preview.sh deck.pptx | xargs -I{} echo --attachment {}
# Exit 0  = something previewable exists (possibly the file itself).
# Exit 3  = no rendition is possible here; the reason is on stderr. Say it in the comment
#           rather than attaching an opaque file and calling it done.
# Exit 2  = the renderer for this class is not installed; the install line is on stderr.
