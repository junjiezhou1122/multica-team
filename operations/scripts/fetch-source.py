"""Resolve, archive and verify entries for the sources register (sources/SOURCES.md).

The register carries every slow-rotting claim the skill makes; this ships with it so an
entry is never hand-typed from memory. `verify.py` asks whether the docs are still true at
release; this is the intake and upkeep tool for the one file that answers "where did you
get this".

    python3 scripts/fetch-source.py --resolve 2411.10109                 # arXiv id
    python3 scripts/fetch-source.py --resolve 10.1038/s41586-026-10742-x # DOI (Crossref)
    python3 scripts/fetch-source.py --resolve https://example.org/paper  # landing-page title
    python3 scripts/fetch-source.py --archive https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10109
    python3 scripts/fetch-source.py --verify                             # walk the register
    python3 scripts/fetch-source.py --verify-citations                   # walk it backwards

`--resolve` fetches metadata (arXiv API for arXiv ids, Crossref for DOIs, the page <title>
otherwise) and prints a ready SOURCES.md block skeleton stamped with today's check-date —
you still write the distillate, set the licence and fill cited-by by hand. `--archive`
best-effort triggers a Wayback Save Page Now and prints the availability-API snapshot link;
a failure degrades to a warning, never an error. `--verify` GETs every live URL in the
register with a browser-ish UA and reports what no longer resolves, with the remediation
ladder: transient? → bot-block? → hunt the successor.

`--verify-citations` walks the same register in the other direction — each entry's
`Cited-by: file:line` back into the docs. Both edges matter: `--verify` proves the evidence
still exists, this proves the skill still uses it. Offline, so it is the cheap one to run.

Stdlib only — no network library beyond urllib, so it runs anywhere Python does.
