# §19 of the company guard — `mise.toml` and the register held to each other — shown refusing each
# mutant and passing its honest twin, in a throwaway company repo. Ported from opsinist's suite of
# the same name, without its `.mcp.json` half: here an MCP server is carried by an agent's
# `mcp_config`, which no commit can see.
#
# **The guard runs on whatever `python3` the machine has, so this suite runs it twice**: once on the
# one on PATH, and once with PATH pointed at the system interpreter (`/usr/bin/python3`, 3.9 on a Mac
# with no Homebrew). §19 parses `mise.toml` by hand precisely so it never imports `tomllib`, which is
# 3.11+; the second pass is the only thing that can show that claim holds.
