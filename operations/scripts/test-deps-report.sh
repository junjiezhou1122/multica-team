# deps-report.py — the updates sorted by what they ask of the owner, and the why of each thing the
# project uses — shown on a throwaway project where `mise`, `npm` and `osv-scanner` are shims that
# print the shapes their own sources produce (read 2026-09-11, cited in the script) and log every
# call they receive.
#
# **Three code mutants, each against the one assertion it should break**: the two mise answers
# merged into one (so "inside the pin" names the newest version outside it), mise's failed-lookup
# warning ignored (so offline reads as current), and a `]` inside a quoted requirement ending the
# array (so every dependency after `pydantic[email]` vanishes from the why view). A mutant that
# does not apply is reported as such — a toothless test and an unapplied mutation look identical.
#
# **Run on every python3 this machine offers**, the system one included: the script reads TOML by
# hand so that it never needs `tomllib`, which is 3.11+, and only a run on the old one shows that.
