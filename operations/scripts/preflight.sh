# A COMMENT inside a block scalar is not an invocation, and the extractor used to hand it to the
# matcher verbatim — so commenting a step out (the ordinary way to stop running something) left
# this gate green. Measured 2026-08-21 (pass twelve): three lenses prescribed three different
# repairs; the matrix that decided between them is in the critic's report. A quoted span is
# dropped for the same reason: `echo "run bash scripts/test-foo.sh to reproduce"` names a suite
# without running it, and an instruction in an echo is documentation, not CI.
# No literal `'` anywhere in this function, and that is not style. This heredoc lives inside
# `$( … )`, and bash 3.2 — the /bin/bash every macOS ships — scans for the closing paren while
# tracking quotes, even through a quoted heredoc it should not be reading at all. An ODD number
# of single quotes here made the substitution swallow 230 further lines and die on a `case` arm
# 240 lines below. Measured 2026-08-21; the same family as this repo's note about `)` in case
# patterns inside `$( … )`.
# A quoted span is dropped only when it holds WHITESPACE. `bash "scripts/test-foo.sh"` is an
# ordinary quoted argument and was being refused (measured 2026-08-23), while the thing this
# dropping exists to kill — `echo "run bash scripts/test-foo.sh to reproduce"` — is prose and
# always has spaces in it. Structural, not a word list: a bare quoted path is an argument, a
# quoted sentence is documentation.
# **Comments are cut BEFORE quotes are unwrapped, and only outside quotes.** Unwrapping first
# let a `#` that had been safely inside a quoted span survive into the plain text, where
# `split("#")` then ate the rest of the line: `sed -i "s/#.*//" x.txt && bash scripts/test-foo.sh`
# became `sed -i s/` and the suite read as never invoked. A regression from the quote change,
# measured 2026-08-23 — and inverted from its intent, since adding a space inside the quotes was
# what made it pass. Scan once, tracking quote state, and cut at the first `#` that is genuinely
# outside one.

    # a pipe into the stream and read as an invocation, where the old blanking could not.
    # Measured 2026-08-23; a class this change introduced, caught by probing its own new behaviour.
    # The metacharacter set is built from ordinals because a literal backtick here can kill the
    # whole file. **Three attempts to state the rule precisely have shipped wrong** — "an odd
    # number of backticks", then "unpaired inside a double-quoted span", then a version that
    # exonerated parentheses and named the hiding places without naming the lexer state they hide
    # in. Each was measured, each was closer, each was still false somewhere.
    #
    # So this stops trying to be a rule and gives you the check. **What is true and small enough to
    # hold:** bash lexes the body of `$( … )` as shell text even through a quoted heredoc, and what
    # it sees there must balance — backticks, parentheses, quotes. Single quotes and a `#` at a
    # word start hide things from it; double quotes hide less than you expect. The failure is
    # always the same shape: `unexpected EOF` reported at the line the substitution OPENED,
    # hundreds of lines above the fault.

# 1b · the documented skill-import URL pins THIS version, not a moving ref.
#      An import becomes agent instructions, so `tree/main` means the content behind someone's
#      agents can change without them moving — the substance of the auditors' W012 finding,
#      2026-07-30. A pin only works if it is maintained, so the maintenance is a check.
#      **SECURITY.md is exempt, on purpose.** It records a URL that was *run once, on a date*, as
#      the control for a measurement. Dragging that forward each release would make the control
#      unreproducible — the exact defect the record exists to avoid — so this check covers
#      instructions, which rot, and not history, which must not move. Verify the exemption is not
#      hiding a real instruction: SECURITY.md gives none, and this asserts it.
#      The exemption is kept honest by a POSITIVE assertion rather than by trying to tell a
#      record from an instruction by its shape — they are the same shape, which is why the first
#      attempt at this guard fired on the record it was written to protect. Instead: INSTALL.md
#      must still carry the pinned line. Move the instruction into the exempt file to dodge the
