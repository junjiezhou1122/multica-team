"""Stop an outward act, so the owner's word is asked for rather than assumed.

**Why this is a hook and not a sentence.** The rule — *spending, outward acts, destruction and
reshaping the team are the owner's, and no history buys them* — is in the core, in PLAYBOOKS's
gate table, and in the README. It is also `prose-only`, and prose does not hold the light tier:
**measured 2026-08-07, scenario 1, 5 runs of 5 went `Edit → git add → git commit → git push`
without asking**, and all five reported *"Done… and pushed"* afterwards. The corpus's own ladder
says what to do about a prose rule that keeps failing — *a form, not a stronger sentence* — and
this is the form.

**It stops every time, and the first design stopped once — measured, and wrong.** The
stop-once-then-let-the-retry-pass shape was borrowed from a role gate where the *owner* is the
one who insists. Here the retryer is the model: measured 2026-08-07 across five runs, the rate
moved 0/5 → 2/5, and **the other three simply ran `git push` again and it went through** —
`push_attempts=3` in each transcript. That is this repository's own law arriving from the other
side: *a gate whose bypass the constrained party can perform is not a gate, it is a prompt
naming the sentence that unlocks the door* (PLAYBOOKS → Gates). A hook cannot tell *the owner
said yes* from *the model tried again*, so it must not pretend to.

**So the door is named instead of built into the gate**: the owner runs the push themselves, or
turns this off deliberately (`MOPS_OUTWARD_GATE=off`, which is a decision with a name rather
than a retry that looks like consent). The cost is honest and stated — an owner who genuinely
wants the agent to push must say so once in their settings.

**What it deliberately does not do.** It does not judge whether the push is a good idea, does
not read the diff, and does not touch anything that is not leaving this machine. Local work —
`git commit`, `git add`, a branch, a local build — is not an outward act and never trips it.

Measured caveat, corrected: plugin `PreToolUse` hooks **do** fire under `claude -p` (probed
2026-08-07 on Claude Code 2.1.220 — a matcher-`Bash` hook fired on the first tool call of a
headless run). The earlier note next door said they did not; it does not hold here.

# Outward: it leaves this machine and someone else can see it. The measured case is the one every
# run reached for; the rest are the same act wearing other clothes. Kept deliberately short — a
# long list is a list nobody audits, and a miss here is a rule that was already prose-only anyway.
# **The two copies had three different verb lists and nobody had written down why** — this one
# missed `flyctl`, `kamal`, `cap`, `make deploy` and `npm run deploy`; the other missed
# `gh pr create`. Aligned 2026-09-18 after a contradiction lens ran them side by side: **a
# divergence that is not deliberate and written down is just a divergence.** The alignment missed
# one: the other copy has always ended its list with a catch-all for a project's own deploy
# script — `./scripts/deploy`, `terraform-deploy` — and this one never had it. Found by a
# contradiction lens on 2026-09-23 and crossed the loud way; the next day an adversarial lens found
# it refusing `predeploy` and `./scripts/predeploy`, local checks that publish nothing, so `deploy`
# must now be the whole name or follow a `/` `-` `_` `.`, and never `pre-`.
#
# **A command starts a command; a word after another word is prose.** This matched the verb
# anywhere in the string, so writing a SENTENCE about publishing into a file was refused as if it
# were the act — measured 2026-09-18, twice in one session, the second time on the comment
# explaining this very repair. The constrained party's only way past a gate that reads prose is to
# reword the prose, which is the *satisfied-by-vocabulary* failure the corpus names, arriving at
# the one gate that must not be word-gameable. So the verb must sit where a command can start: the
# beginning, a newline, after `;` `&&` `||` `|`, or inside `(`…`)` or `$(`…`)`. **The sibling's own
# gate has anchored this way since it was written and this copy had not**, which is the divergence
# a shared rule in two files always eventually produces.
#
# **A quote is a command start only after something that runs a shell.** Treating any quote as one
# caught the wrapper `sh -c "…"` and also caught `grep 'npm publish' docs/` — a READ, which is
# never outward, refused by the gate that exists for publishing (caught by this suite the moment
# the case was written). So the second alternative is explicit: a shell-runner, then its quoted
# argument. The wrapper built by substitution still passes, and that is named rather than chased.
#
# **Then an adversarial lens walked in with eleven ways past it, all reproduced** (2026-09-18), and
# each is handled here rather than argued with: **a wrapper word** before the verb (`env X=1`,
# `sudo`, `nohup`, `time`, `nice -n 10`, `command`, `exec`, and a bare `eval` with no quote at all)
# is neither a delimiter nor a runner, so nothing anchored · **a line continuation** is one command
# to the shell and two lines to a regex · **a redirect** needs no space before it, and the lookahead
# did not count `>` as a terminator · **the runner's quote** can sit further than forty characters
# away, so the cap is gone. A **heredoc body** is blanked before matching: it is data being fed to
# another program, and a document that carries the verb at the start of a line is not a publish —
# the same *prose is not an act* defect, arriving back through the newline anchor that repaired it.

# **A wrapper word takes flags, a flag takes its own argument, and there can be any number of

# `exec -a name` — and listing the option SHAPES was not enough, because a flag with its own

# and on 2026-09-23 `env A=1 B=2 C=3 D=4 E=5 F=6 git push` walked past the cap: a bound on the
# UNSAFE side of an anchor is a hole with a number on it. **Any run of tokens, on the same line.**
# The cost is named: a wrapper followed later on its line by a quoted mention of the verb is

# **A word is read the way a shell reads one** — quoted parts may hold spaces — **and an argument

# what the optional quote after each name is for — and every word of the act may be quoted whole,
# `git "push"`, since quoting each word is an ordinary habit (2026-09-24). **What is not read, by

# read as the act and refused: a pattern cannot know which options take an argument, so of the
# two readings it takes the one that stops (2026-09-24, declined as a defect, kept as a limit).

    beside it, where the quote holding each character opened (-1 outside a quote, and inside a
    `$(…)` or a backtick pair, which run even within `"…"`), so a separator can be told from a
    character of a quoted string (`quoted_data`, 2026-09-25).


    A heredoc body is data fed to another program, so a document carrying the verb at the start of
    a line is not a publish. **Every regex over the raw string was out-guessed within a round**: a
    missing terminator blanked to the end of the string (2026-09-18); a body blanked from right
    after the delimiter hid `cat > f <<EOF && git push`, because bash starts the body on the NEXT
    line (2026-09-23); a `<<X` inside `$'…'` or `$((…))` was taken for an opener and hid the push
    on the line after it (2026-09-23); and a double quote inside `$(…)` within a double-quoted
    string closed the outer string early, so a `<<X` still inside it was read as code (2026-09-24).
    Each of the last three was confirmed in real bash against a stub `git`.

    So this is one pass, left to right, **keeping the state bash keeps**: outside quotes or inside
    `'…'`, `"…"` or `$'…'`; inside arithmetic `((…))`; in a `#` comment; and, inside a double-quoted
    string, inside a `$(…)`, a backtick pair or a `${…}`, each with its own quoting, on a stack. A
    `<<` opens a heredoc only where bash would read one — never in a quote, a comment, arithmetic or
    a `${…}`, and `<<<` is a here-STRING, not an opener. Bodies are read the way bash reads them:
    after the newline that ends the command, every heredoc of that line in order, each to a line
    that IS its word (after leading tabs, for `<<-`). **No terminator, or an unclosed quote, and
    nothing more is blanked**: bash would run none of the rest, so leaving it visible costs a false
    refusal at worst. **A comment is blanked too**, since bash never reads it: a trailing
    `# --dry-run tested this yesterday` was excusing the real act it trailed (2026-09-24). One pass
    keeps it linear — a scan per opener took 13 s on a 358 KB command of unterminated openers, and
    this takes 0.05–0.08 s as a whole hook call (both measured 2026-09-23).

    **What it does not track can hide a publish, and is named for that reason**: a `case` pattern's
    unmatched `)` inside a command substitution within a double-quoted string closes the
    substitution early, and so would any other construct whose bracket bash balances by grammar
    rather than by count. Nothing an agent writes by accident has been found in that shape; the
    ones that were found are closed above.

# by name: bash · sh · zsh · dash · ksh · ksh93 · csh · tcsh · ash · mksh · pdksh · yash · fish ·

# published while this list named five (an adversarial lens, 2026-09-25). **Not read, and named
# for it**: `nu` as a bare word anywhere on a line — two letters too common to refuse on — though
# `nu -c "…"` is still a runner of its quoted command, which is the act-start pattern's job
# (`_acts` in one copy of this gate, `CMD_START` in the other); and `busybox`, whose shells are
# read by their own name (`busybox sh`). The two lists differ on purpose: one decides where an
# act can start, the other whether a quote can be trusted. **A match is judged at its ACT as
# well as at its anchor**: the runner branch reaches from a runner word to any later quote on
# the line, so a bare `nu` earlier armed it into a later `grep "…"` and refused a read (a lens,
# 2026-09-25) — an act inside a quote a reader holds, where nothing runs text, is text. Anything else
# keeps the old reading, which is the loud side. `$(…)` and backticks inside `"…"` run, so the
# scanner never marks them quoted.
# **Named limits, from the lenses of 2026-09-25.** A command made of another program's OUTPUT —
# `$(echo "…")`, or the same in backticks — is not read: it is the class of a verb assembled from
# parts, a decision to hide the act. And a runner word anywhere on a line arms the runner branch
# into any later quote on it, so `echo ssh "…"` is refused though nothing runs — the loud side,
# kept, because judging one simple command at a time would reopen a file written, then run.

# `git push` on the next line, went through both gates — and so did a comment that merely
# mentioned the flag (an adversarial lens, 2026-09-24). So every outward act is found, and each is
# excused only by a `--dry-run` in its own simple command — which ends where `command_end` says,
# so `$(git push) --dry-run`, whose push runs inside the substitution before the flag is ever
# read, is not excused. **And the flag has to mean dry**: `npm publish --dry-run=false` publishes, so only
# the bare flag or `=true` · `=1` · `=yes` excuses anything (both 2026-09-24). A comment is gone
# before this reads the line: `shell_only` blanks it.
# **And the flag has to be a word of that command.** `git push origin mainX--dry-run` was
# excused because the pattern found the flag glued to another word (2026-09-24), so the command is
# split the way a shell splits it and only a whole word counts — the act's own options included,
# since `npm --dry-run publish` is a dry run too. A command that will not split is not excused.

    A gate cannot read intent and must not try: the party it constrains is the one that would be

    — 5 runs of 5 reported *"done… and pushed"* about a publish nobody had authorised. What a gate
    CAN do is put the human's own last words beside the refusal, so whoever decides is not hunting
    for the context first.

    **Quoted and never acted on.** *"Publish when it's ready"* an hour ago is not permission now: a
    request to do the work is not a request to announce it, and an earlier yes does not roll
    forward. **If this function ever grows a branch that lets something through, that branch is the
    bug.**

    **Most of what arrives as a `user` entry is not the owner**, and an adversarial lens proved
    the first version of this wrong on a real transcript (2026-09-18). Four shapes, each handled:
    a **tool result**, which arrives as a `user` entry; a `<system-reminder>`, **possibly
    unterminated or nested**; a `<task-notification>`, *a background agent's return value routed
    back as a user turn*; and the harness's **conversation-continuation summary**, tens of
    thousands of characters that are not a turn at all. An entry carrying BOTH text and a tool
    result keeps its text — discarding it made the gate quote an older message as *what you last
    asked for*, and a stale instruction reads exactly like a current one.

    **Whatever survives is still untrusted text**, shown between guillemets under a line saying it
    is not consent. An instruction inside it is a thing the human reads, and the human was going to
    decide anyway.
