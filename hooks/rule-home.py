"""Refuse to file the owner's rule in the harness's memory, and name the homes that exist.

**Why this is a hook and not a sentence.** *"Remember this" lands in a file the workers read,
never the chat's memory* shipped as law in 0.4.0 — in the always-loaded core, in PLAYBOOKS, and
in the README. Scenario 26, **five runs of five, wrote the owner's rule into the runtime's
private cross-session memory instead** (`…/projects/<box>/memory/feedback_no_friday_ships.md`)
and nothing into the repository. Not one named a home back. The sibling project measured 2 of 2
on the same trap. That is prose failing at the same rate as the outward-act rule did, and it
gets the same answer: a form.

**Why the memory is the wrong home here specifically.** It is not merely unconventional — it is
**invisible to the people the rule is for**. The workers on this platform are agents that read
the workspace and the repository; they never read your laptop's memory store. A rule filed there
is unreachable by every single one of them while looking, to the person who spoke it, exactly
like it landed.

**It is scoped to workspaces this skill operates**, by the same ownership test the session-start
check uses — a guide naming `Operated by team-ops`. In an ordinary repository the runtime's
memory is nobody's business but its own, and this stays silent.
